        <p class='box'>Having grown up with five older brothers and an entrepreneur for a father, I’ve always 
            lived in a competitive and high-achieving environment. My family’s example of pursuing 
            opportunities and valuing hard work has led me from Mesa, AZ to Brigham Young University 
            and KPMG.
        
        <br><br>

        I am a Pre-Business student looking to apply to either the Accounting, Strategy, or Supply 
        Chain program this summer and I currently have experience in FTA compliance, management, 
        bookkeeping, and financial & data analysis.
        <br><br>

        My interests include volleyball, fantasy basketball, Settlers of Catan, Monopoly, attending 
        church services, and spending time with my wife Melanie.</p>
